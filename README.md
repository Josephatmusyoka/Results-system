# Results System

This is a results management system built with Flask, designed to help administrators and students manage student results efficiently. The system allows admin users to manage students' data, while students can view their own results.

## Features

- **Admin Login & Dashboard**: Admin users can log in and view the dashboard to manage students' data.
- **Student Login & Dashboard**: Students can log in to view their personal information and results.
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Both students and admins can register and log in to their respective portals.
- **Manage Results**: Admin can manage and update students' results.
- **Session Management**: Both students and admins can stay logged in for easy navigation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (or other databases)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management
- **Password Hashing**: Werkzeug

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLite (or other databases for production)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Josephatmusyoka/Results-system.git
Database Setup
The application uses a SQLite database (students.db). Upon the first run, the tables will be created automatically.

### Notes:
1. **Tech Stack**: I've listed Flask, SQLite, and other libraries based on what you're currently using. You can adjust it according to any future changes or new technologies you integrate.
2. **Database Setup**: This assumes SQLite is used for development. You can change it to MySQL or another database if needed in production.
3. **Admin and Student Login Details**: For now, placeholders like `[your admin username]` are included. Replace them with actual admin or student credentials when you have set them up in your database.
4. **Future Enhancements**: You can update this section as your project evolves.
